Exercise 52: The Most Important Lesson
**************************************

You have done something that many other people haven't by going through
this book and learning to write software.  However, you might not realize
how much you actually know about the subject.  In order for you to get
a perspective on your knowledge, and to help you understand what you know
I'm going to ask you to do something intimidating:

*I want you to teach someone else exercises 1 through 5 of this book.*

That's right, you're going to be a teacher for a day and get a new person
into programming.  Who knows, mabye they'll become interested and continue
after you're done.  Maybe they'll think it's stupid and just forget about
it.

The purpose of this lesson though is to get you to articulate what you know
and try to explain it to someone else.  Doing this will help you get an
even firmer and cleaner grasp of what you know.

A piano teach I took a few lessons from told me that he played professionally
in many Jazz bands, playing all sorts of complex music, but it wasn't until he
started *teaching* Jazz that he actually understood what he was doing.

Teaching someone else forces you to really understand what you're doing.

* Find your local "python group" and go to a meeting.  If there isn't one, then
  try starting one with some of your friends.
