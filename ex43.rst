Exercise 43: Evaluating Your Game
*********************************

In this exercise you're going to evaluate the game you just made.  Maybe you got
part way through it and you got stuck.  Maybe you got it working but just barely.
Either way, we're going to go through a bunch of things you should know now and 
make sure you covered them in your game.  We're going to study how to properly
format a class, common conventions in using them, and a lot of "textbook" knowledge.

Why would I have you try to do it yourself and then show you how to do it right?
From now on in the book I'm going to try to make you self-sufficient.  I've been
holding your hand mostly this whole time, and I can't do that for much longer.
I'm now instead going to give you things to do, have you do them on your own,
and then give you ways to improve what you did and make them better.

Hopefully you'll struggle at first, and probably be very frustrated but stick
with it and eventually you'll build a mind for solving problems.  You'll start
to find creative solutions to problems rather than just copy solutions out of
textbooks.
