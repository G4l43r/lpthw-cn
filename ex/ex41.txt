--------
The Gothons of Planet Percal #25 have invaded your ship and destroyed
your entire crew.  You are the last surviving member and your last
mission is to get the neutron destruct bomb from the Weapons Armory,
put it in the bridge, and blow the ship up after getting into an 
escape pod.


You're running down the central corridor to the Weapons Armory when
a Gothon jumps out, red scaly skin, dark grimy teeth, and evil clown costume
flowing around his hate filled body.  He's blocking the door to the
Armory and about to pull a weapon to blast you.
> dodge!
Like a world class boxer you dodge, weave, slip and slide right
as the Gothon's blaster cranks a laser past your head.
In the middle of your artful dodge your foot slips and you
bang your head on the metal wall and pass out.
You wake up shortly after only to die as the Gothon stomps on
your head and eats you.

--------
Such a luser.

> tell a joke
Lucky for you they made you learn Gothon insults in the academy.
You tell the one Gothon joke you know:
Lbhe zbgure vf fb sng, jura fur fvgf nebhaq gur ubhfr, fur fvgf nebhaq gur ubhfr.
The Gothon stops, tries not to laugh, then busts out laughing and can't move.
While he's laughing you run up and shoot him square in the head
putting him down, then jump through the Weapon Armory door.

--------
You do a dive roll into the Weapon Armory, crouch and scan the room
for more Gothons that might be hiding.  It's dead quiet, too quiet.
You stand up and run to the far side of the room and find the
neutron bomb in its container.  There's a keypad lock on the box
and you need the code to get the bomb out.  If you get the code
wrong 10 times then the lock closes forever and you can't
get the bomb.  The code is 3 digits.

The lock buzzes one last time and then you hear a sickening
melting sound as the mechanism is fused together.
You decide to sit there, and finally the Gothons blow up the
ship from their ship and you die.

--------
You died.  You kinda suck at this.
