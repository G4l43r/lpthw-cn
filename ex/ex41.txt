You see a beautiful Princess with a shiny crown.
She offers you some cake.
> make her eat it
The Princess screams as you cram the cake in her mouth.
Then she smiles and cries and thanks you for saving her.
She points to a tiny door and says, 'The Koi needs cake too.'
She gives you the very last bit of cake and shoves you in.

--------
There is a garden with a koi pond in the center.
You walk close and see a massive fin poke out.
You peek in and a creepy looking huge Koi stares at you.
It opens its mouth waiting for food.
> throw it in
The Koi wiggles, then leaps into the air to eat the cake.
You can see it's happy, it then grunts, thrashes...
and finally rolls over and poops a magic diamond into the air
at your feet.

--------
Puzzled, you are about to pick up the fish poop diamond when
a bear bearing a load bearing sword walks in.
"Hey! That' my diamond! Where'd you get that!?"
It holds its paw out and looks at you.
> say no
The bear looks shocked.  Nobody ever told a bear
with a broadsword 'no'.  It asks, 
"Is it because it's not a katana?  I could go get one!"
It then runs off and now you notice a big iron gate.
"Where the hell did that come from?" You say.

--------
You walk up to the big iron gate and see there's a handle.
> open it
You open it and you are free!
There are mountains.  And berries! And...
Oh, but then the bear comes with his katana and stabs you.
"Who's laughing now!?  Love this katana."

--------
I have a small puppy that's better at this.
