Exercise 2: Comments And Pound Characters
*****************************************

Comments are very important in your programs.  They are used to tell you
what something does in English, and they also are used to disable parts
of your program if you need to remove them temporarily.  Here's how you
do comments.

.. literalinclude:: ex/ex2.py
    :language: python
    :linenos:

.. warning::

    This book uses "syntax highlighting", which means that the code looks like
    it has colors for different symbols and letters.  This helps you read it so
    that you can see some errors, and your editor should use similar coloring,
    but maybe not exactly the same.

What You Should See
===================

.. literalinclude:: ex/ex2.txt


Extra Credit
============

1. Find out if you were right about what the # character does and make sure you know what it's called (octothorpe character).
2. Take your ``ex2.py`` file and review each line going backwards.  Start at the last line, and check each word in reverse against what you should have typed.
3. Did you find more mistakes?  Fix them.
4. Read what you typed above out loud, including saying each character by its name.  Did you find more mistakes?  Fix them.


.. note::

    An 'octothorpe' is also called a 'pound', 'hash', 'mesh', or any number of names.  Pick the one that makes you chill out.
