Exercise 2: Comments And Pound Characters
*****************************************

Comments are very important in your programs.  They are used to tell you
what something does in English, and they also are used to disable parts
of your program if you need to remove them temporarily.  Here's how you
use comments in Python:

.. literalinclude:: ex/ex2.py
    :language: python
    :linenos:

What You Should See
===================

.. literalinclude:: ex/ex2.txt
    :language: console


Extra Credit
============

1. Find out if you were right about what the # character does and make sure you know what it's called (octothorpe or pound character).
2. Take your ``ex2.py`` file and review each line going backwards.  Start at the last line, and check each word in reverse against what you should have typed.
3. Did you find more mistakes?  Fix them.
4. Read what you typed above out loud, including saying each character by its name.  Did you find more mistakes?  Fix them.
