Exercise 7: More Printing
*************************

We are now going to do a bunch of exercises where you just type code in
and make them run.  There won't be much talking since it's just more of
the same.  The purpose is to build up your chops.  See you in a few 
exercises, and *don't skip!*

Extra Credit
============

For these next few exercises you will have the exact same extra credit.

1. Go back through and write a comment on what each line does.
2. Read each one backwards or out loud to find your errors.
3. From now on, when you make mistakes write down on a piece of paper what
   kind of mistake you made.
4. When you go to the next exercise, look at the last mistakes you made and
   try not to make them in this new one.
5. Remember that everyone makes mistakes.  Programmers are like magicians who
   like everyone to think they're perfect and never wrong, but it's all an act.
   They make mistakes all the time.
