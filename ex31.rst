Exercise 31: Making Decisions
*****************************

In the first half of this book you mostly just printed out things and called 
functions, but everything was basically in a straight line.  Your scripts ran
starting at the top, and went to the bottom where they ended.  If you 
made a function you could run that function later, but it still didn't
have the kind of branching you need to really make decisions.  Now that
you have ``if``, ``else``, and ``elif`` you can start to make scripts that
decide things.

In the last script you wrote out a simple set of tests asking some questions.
In this script you will ask the user questions and make decisions based
on their answers.  Write this script, and then play with it quite a lot
to figure it out.

A key point here is that you are now putting the ``if-statements`` *inside*
``if-statements`` as code that can run.  This is very powerful and can be used
to create "nested" decisions, where one branch leads to another and another.

Make sure you understand this concept of if-statements inside
if-statements.  In fact, do the extra credit to really nail it.


What You Should See

Here is me playing this little adventure game.  I do not do so well.

Extra Credit
============

Make new parts of the game and change what decisions people can make.  Expand
the game out as much as you can before it gets ridiculous.
