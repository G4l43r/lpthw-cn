Prompting And Passing
*********************

Let's do one exercise to put using ``argv`` and ``raw_input`` together to
ask the user something specific.  You'll need this for the next exercise
where we learn to read and write files.  In this exercise we'll use
``raw_input`` slightly differently by having it just pring a simple ``>``
prompt.  Similar to in a game like Zork or Adventure.


.. literalinclude:: ex/ex14.py
    :linenos:


Notice though that we make a variable ``prompt`` that is set to this prompt we
want, and then we give that to ``raw_input`` instead of typing it over and
over.  Now if we want to make the prompt something else, we just have to
change it in this one spot and rerun the script.

Very handy.


What You Should See
===================

When you run this one, remember that you have to give the script your
name for the ``argv`` arguments.

.. literalinclude:: ex/ex14.txt


Extra Credit
============

1. Go find out what Zork was, and what Adventure was.
   See if you can find a copy and play it.
2. Change the ``prompt`` variable to something else entirely.
3. Add another argument and use it in your script.
4. Make sure you understand how I combined a ``"""`` style multi-line string
   with the ``%`` format activator as the last print.
