Exercise 14: Prompting And Passing
**********************************

Let's do one exercise that uses ``argv`` and ``raw_input`` together to
ask the user something specific.  You will need this for the next exercise
where we learn to read and write files.  In this exercise we'll use
``raw_input`` slightly differently by having it just print a simple ``>``
prompt.  This is similar to a game like Zork or Adventure.


.. literalinclude:: ex/ex14.py
    :linenos:


Notice though that we make a variable ``prompt`` that is set to the prompt we
want, and we give that to ``raw_input`` instead of typing it over and
over.  Now if we want to make the prompt something else, we just 
change it in this one spot and rerun the script.

Very handy.


What You Should See
===================

When you run this, remember that you have to give the script your
name for the ``argv`` arguments.

.. literalinclude:: ex/ex14.txt
    :language: console


Extra Credit
============

1. Find out what Zork and Adventure were.
   Try to find a copy and play it.
2. Change the ``prompt`` variable to something else entirely.
3. Add another argument and use it in your script.
4. Make sure you understand how I combined a ``"""`` style multi-line string
   with the ``%`` format activator as the last print.
