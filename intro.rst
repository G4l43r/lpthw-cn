The Hard Way Is Easier
**********************

This simple book is meant to give you a first start in programming.  The title
says it is the hard way to learn to write code but it's actually not.  It's the
"hard" way only in that it's the way people used to teach things.  In this book
you will do something incredibly simple that all programmers actually do to
learn a language:

1. Go through each exercise.
2. Type in each sample *exactly*.
3. Make it run.

That's it.  This will be *very* difficult at first, but stick with it.  If you
go through this book, and do each exercise for 1-2 hours a night, then you'll
have a good foundation for moving on to another book.  You might not really
learn "programming" from this book, but you will learn the foundation skills you
need to start learning the language.

This book's job is to teach you the three most basic essential skills that a
beginning programmer needs to know: Reading And Writing, Attention To Detail,
Spotting Differences.


Reading And Writing
===================

It seems stupidly obvious, but if you have a problem typing you'll have a
problem learning to code.  Not only that, but if you have a problem typing the
fairly odd characters in source code then you'll be unable to learn even the
most basic things about how software works.

Typing the code samples and getting them to run will help you learn the names of
the symbols, get familiar with typing them, and get you reading the language.

Attention To Detail
===================

The one skill that separates bad programmers from good programmers is attention
to detail.  In fact, it's what separate the good from the bad in any profession.
Without an attention to the tiniest details of your work you'll miss key
important elements of what you create.  In programming this is how you end up
with bugs and difficult to use systems.

By going through this book and copying each example *exactly* you will be
training your brain to focus on exacting details of what you are doing.


Spotting Differences
====================

A very important skill that most programmers develop over time is the ability to
visually notice differences between things.  An experienced programmer can take
two pieces of code that are slightly different and immediately start pointing
out the differences.  In fact, programmers have invented tools to make this even
easier.  Of course, the invention of these tools also means that even with years
of training finding little differences in programming is difficult.

While you do these exercises and type each one in, you'll be making mistakes.
It's inevitable, and even seasoned programmers would make a few mistakes.  Your
job is to compare what you've written to what's required and fix all the
differences, and by doing this you'll train yourself to notice your mistakes,
bugs, and other problems caused by them.
