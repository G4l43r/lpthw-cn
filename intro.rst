The Hard Way Is Easier
**********************

This simple book is meant to give you a first start in programming.  The title
says it is the hard way to learn to write code; but it's actually not.  It's the
"hard" way only in that it's the way people used to teach things.  With the help
of this book, you'll do the incredibly simple things that all programmers need to
do to learn a language:

1. Go through each exercise.
2. Type in each sample *exactly*.
3. Make it run.

That's it.  This will be *very* difficult at first, but stick with it.  If you
go through this book, and do each exercise for 1-2 hours a night, you'll
have a good foundation for moving on to another book.  You might not really
learn "programming" from this book, but you will learn the foundation skills you
need to start learning the language.

This book's job is to teach you the three most essential skills that a
beginning programmer needs to know: Reading and Writing, Attention to Detail,
Spotting Differences.


Reading and Writing
===================

It seems stupidly obvious, but, if you have a problem typing, you'll have a
problem learning to code.  Not only that, but, if you have a problem typing the
fairly odd characters in source code, you'll be unable to learn even the
most basic things about how software works.

Typing the code samples and getting them to run will help you learn the names of
the symbols, get familiar with typing them, and get you reading the language.

Attention to Detail
===================

The one skill that separates bad programmers from good programmers is attention
to detail.  In fact, it's what separates the good from the bad, in any profession.
Without paying attention to the tiniest details of your work, you'll miss key
elements of what you create.  In programming, this is how you end up
with bugs and difficult to use systems.

By going through this book and copying each example *exactly*, you will be
training your brain to focus on the details of what you are doing, as you are doing it.


Spotting Differences
====================

A very important skill -- that most programmers develop over time -- is the ability to
visually notice differences between things.  An experienced programmer can take
two pieces of code that are slightly different and immediately start pointing
out the differences.  In fact, programmers have invented tools to make this even
easier, but we won't be using any of these tools.  You first have to train your
brain the hard way, then you can use the tools.

While you do these exercises, typing each one in, you'll be making mistakes.
It's inevitable; even seasoned programmers would make a few.  Your
job is to compare what you've written to what's required, and fix all the
differences.  By doing so, you'll train yourself to notice mistakes,
bugs, and other problems.


Do Not Copy-Paste
=================

The last thing I'll say before we begin is that you must *type* each of these
exercises in, manually.  If you copy and paste, you might as well just not even
do them.  The point of these exercises is to train your hands, your brain, and
your mind in how to read, write, and see code.  If you copy-paste, you are cheating
yourself out of the effectiveness of the lessons.
