Next Steps
**********

You are not a programmer quite yet.  I like to think of this book
as giving you your "programming brown belt".  You know enough to
be able to start another book on programming and handle
it just fine.  This book should have given you the mental tools
and attitude you need to go through most Python books and actually
learn something.  It might even make it easy.

On the http://learnpythonthehardway.org/ website there are a few free books you
should move onto next.  Try them out and see how far you can get.

You could probably start hacking away at some programs right now,
and if you have that itch, go ahead.  Just understand, anything
you write will probably suck.  That's alright though, I suck at
every programming language I first start using.  Nobody writes
pure perfect gold when they are a beginner, and anyone who tells you
they did is a huge liar.

Finally, remember that this is something you have to do for a while
and for at least a couple hours every night.  If it helps, while
you are struggling through learning Python every night, I'm hard
at work learning to play guitar.  I work at it about 2 or 4 hours
a day and still practice scales.

Everyone is a beginner at something.
