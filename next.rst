Next Steps
**********

You are not a programmer quite yet.  I like to think of this book as giving you
your "programming brown belt".  You know enough to be able to start another
book on programming and handle it just fine.  This book should have given you
the mental tools and attitude you need to go through most Python books and
actually learn something.  It might even make it easy.

I recommend you continue on to http://www.djangobook.com/ and start going
through the 2nd Edition of *The Django Book*.  Even if you never plan on doing
Python web programming, going through the book will cement your skills in
Python using an actual practical activity.  It is also a better framework than
the ``lpthw.web`` you were using, but all of the concepts you've learned so far
apply to the ``Django`` web framework.  Just take your time, ask questions, and
you'll get through it.

You could probably start hacking away at some programs right now, and if you
have that itch, go ahead.  Just understand, anything you write will probably
suck.  That's alright though, I suck at every programming language I first
start using.  Nobody writes pure perfect gold when they are a beginner, and
anyone who tells you they did is a huge liar.

Finally, remember that this is something you have to do at least a couple hours
a night for a while before you can get good.  If it helps, while you are
struggling to learn Python every night, I'm hard at work learning to play
guitar.  I work at it about 2 or 4 hours a day and still practice scales.

Everyone is a beginner at something.
