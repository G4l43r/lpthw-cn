Exercise 3: Numbers And Math
****************************

Every programming language has some kind of way of doing numbers and math.
Don't worry, programmers lie frequently about being math geniuses when they
really aren't.  If they were math geniuses, they would be doing math not
writing ads and social network games to steal people's money.

This exercise has lots of math symbols so let's name them right away so you know
what they're called.  As you type this one in, say the names.  When saying them
feels boring you can stop saying them.  Here's the names:

* ``+``           plus
* ``-``           minus
* ``/``           slash
* ``*``           asterisk
* ``%``           percent
* ``<``           less-than
* ``>``           greater-than
* ``<=``          less-than-equal
* ``>=``          greater-than-equal

Notice how the operations are missing?  After you type in the code
for this exercise you are to go back and figure out what each of
these does and complete the table.  For example, ``+`` does addition.

.. literalinclude:: ex/ex3.py
    :linenos:


What You Should See
===================

.. literalinclude:: ex/ex3.txt


Extra Credit
============

1. Above each line, use the ``#`` to write a comment to yourself explaining what the line does.
2. Remember in Exercise 0 when you started python?  Start python this way 
   again and using the above characters and what you know, use python as a calculator.
3. Find something you need to calculate and write a new ``.py`` file that does it.
4. Notice the math seems "wrong"?  There are no fractions, only whole numbers.
   Find out why by researching what a "floating point" number means.
5. Rewrite ``ex3.py`` to use floating point numbers so it's more accurate.
