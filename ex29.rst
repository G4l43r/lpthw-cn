Exercise 29: What If
********************

Here is the next script of Python you will enter, which introduces you to
the ``if-statement``.  Type this in, make it run exactly right and then 
we'll try see if your practice has paid off.

.. literalinclude:: ex/ex29.py
    :linenos:


What You Should See

.. literalinclude:: ex/ex29.txt



Extra Credit
============

In this extra credit, you are going to try to guess what you think
the ``if-statement`` is and what it does.  Try to answer these questions
in your own words before moving on to the next exercise:

1. What do you think the ``if`` does to the code under it?
2. Why does the code under the ``if`` need to be indented 4 spaces?
3. What happens if it isn't indented?
4. Can you put other boolean expressions from Ex. 26 in the ``if-statement``? 
   Try it.
5. What happens if you change the initial variables for ``people``, ``cats``, and
   ``dogs``?
