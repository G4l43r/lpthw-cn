Exercise 51: Getting Input From A Browser
*****************************************

While it's exciting to see the browser display "Hello World", it's even
more exciting to let the user submit text to your application from
a form.  In this exercise we will improve our starter web application
using forms and storing information about the user into their "session"
so we can work with it.

How The Web Works
=================

Before you can make a form it helps to understand a little bit about
how the world wide web actually works.  This description isn't complete,
but it is accurate and will help you figure out what might be going wrong
with your application.  It will also make it easier for you to create
forms if you know what they do.



How Forms Work
==============



Your First Form Application
===========================



Writing A Unit Test For Your Form
=================================



Creating A Layout Template
==========================



A Single Room Game
==================



Extra Credit
============

1. Create a separate new project and make a simple number guessing game that creates a
   random number, and then asks the person until they get the number right or give up.
2. Write unit tests for this game too, as practice for doing the unit testing.
3. Read even more about HTML, and try to make the single room game have a better or
   at least different layout.  It helps to draw what you want to do on paper and *then*
   implement it with HTML.
4. This one is hard, but try to figure out how you'd do a file upload form so that you can
   upload an image and save it to the disk.
