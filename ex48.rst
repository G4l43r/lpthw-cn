Exercise 48: Advanced User Input
*******************************

Your game probably was coming along great, but I bet how you handled what the
user typed was becoming tedious.  Each room needed it's own very exact set of
phrases that only worked if your player typed them perfectly.  What you'd rather
have is a device that let users type phrases in various ways and the game would
still work.  For example, we'd like to have all of these phrases work the same:

* open door
* open the door
* go THROUGH the door
* punch bear
* Punch The Bear in the FACE

It should be alright for a user to write something a lot like English to work
with your game, and have your game figure out what they mean.  To do this, we're
going to write a module who's job is just that.  This module will have a few 
classes that work together to handle use input and convert it into something your
game can work with reliably.
