Exercise 10: What Was That?
***************************

In Exercise 9 I threw you some new stuff you haven't seen yet, just to keep
you on your toes.  In that exercise I showed you two ways to make a string
that goes across multiple lines.  In the first way, I put the characters
\n (back-slash ``n``) between the names of the months.  What these two characters
do is put a ``new line character`` into the string at that point.

This use of the \ (back-slash) character is a way we can put difficult to type
characters into a string.  There's plenty of these "escape sequences" available
for different characters you might want to put in, but there's a special one,
the ``double back-slash`` which is just two of them ``\\``.  These two characters
will print just one back-slash.  We'll try a few of these sequences so you can
see what I mean.

The second way is by doing the triple-quotes, which is just ``"""`` and works
like a string, but what it does you can put as many lines of text you want
until you type ``"""`` again.  We'll also play with these some too.

What You Should See
===================

Look for the tab characters that you made.  In this exercise the spacing is
important to get right.

Extra Credit
============

1. Go search online to see what other escape sequences are available.
2. Try using ``'''`` instead.  Can you see why you might use that instead of ``"""``?
3. Try to combine escape sequences and format strings to create a more complex format.
