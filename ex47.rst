Exercise 47: Automated Testing
******************************

Having to type commands into your game over and over again just to make sure
it's working is annoying.  Wouldn't it be better to write little pieces of code
that test your code?  Then when you make a change, or add a new thing to your
program, you just "run your tests" and the tests make sure things are still 
working.  These automated tests won't catch all your bugs, but they will 
cut down on the time you spend repeatedly typing and running your code.
