Exercise 35: 分支和函数
********************************

你已经学会了 ``if语句``, 函数, 还有数组. 现在你要练习扭转一下思维了. 把下面的代码
写下来, 看你是否能弄懂它实现的是什么功能.

.. literalinclude:: ex/ex35.py
    :linenos:


你应该看到的结果
===================

Here's me taking too much gold:

.. literalinclude:: ex/ex35.txt


加分习题
============

1. Draw a map of the game and how you flow through it.
2. Fix all of your mistakes, including spelling mistakes.
3. Write comments for the functions you do not understand.  Remember doc comments?
4. Add more to the game.  What can you do to both simplify and expand it.
5. The ``gold_room`` has a weird way of getting you to type a number.  What are all
   the bugs in this way of doing it?  Can you make it better than just checking if
   "1" or "0" are in the number?  Look at how ``int()`` works for clues.
