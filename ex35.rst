Exercise 35: Branches and Functions
********************************

You have learned to do ``if-statements``, and you can do functions.  You
also know arrays.  Now it's time to bend your mind.  Type this in, and
see if you can figure out what it's doing.

.. literalinclude:: ex/ex35.py
    :linenos:


What You Should See
===================

Here's me taking too much gold:

.. literalinclude:: ex/ex35.txt


Extra Credit
============

1. Draw a map of the game and how you flow through it.
2. Fix all of your mistakes, including spelling mistakes.
3. Write comments for the functions you don't understand.  Remember doc comments?
4. Add more to the game.  How much can you do to simplify it and still expand it.
5. The ``gold_room`` has a weird way of getting you to type a number.  What are all
   the bugs in this way of doing it?  Can you make it better than just checking if
   "1" or "0" are in the number?  Look at how ``int()`` works for clues.
