Advice From An Old Programmer
*****************************

You've finished this book, and now you've decided to continue on with
programming.  Maybe it will be a career for you; maybe you'll just do it as
a hobby.  Whatever way you choose to go, though, I want to make sure you
continue on the right path.  To that end, allow me to give you some advice.

I've been programming for a very long time.  So long that it is incredibly
boring to me.  At the time I wrote this book, I knew about 20 programming
languages, and could learn new ones in anything between a day and a week --
depending on how weird they were.  Eventually, though, this became very dull,
and couldn't hold my interest anymore.

What I've discovered, on this journey through programming, is that languages
don't matter; it's what you do with them that counts.  Actually, I've always
known that.  But I'd get distracted by whatever the language of the week was,
and I'd periodically forget it.  Now, I never forget it; and neither should you.

The programming languages you know and use do not matter. Do *not* get sucked
into the religion surrounding languages.  If you do, it will blind you to their
true purpose -- being a tool you use to do interesting things.

Programming is the *only* art form that allows you to create interactive
art.  You can create projects that your audience can actually play with.  No
other art form allows for quite this level of dialogue.  They all go in
only one direction: from you (the artist), to the audience.  Code, though, goes
both ways.

Programming as a profession is only moderately interesting.  It can be a good
job, but, if you want to make about the same money and be happier, you could
just go run a fast food joint.  You are much better off using code as
your secret weapon, in another profession.

In the world of technology companies, people who can code are a dime a
dozen.  However, people who can code in biology, medicine, government,
sociology, physics, history, or mathematics are few and far between -- and,
with code as the ace up their sleeves, they can do amazing things.

Finally, I'll tell you that learning to create software changes you; it makes you
different.  No better; no worse; but definitely different.  You may find that people
treat you harshly, because you can code -- maybe throwing words like
"nerd" at you.  You may find that, because you can dissect their logic, they
hate arguing with you.  And you may even find that simply knowing how a computer
works makes them think of you as annoying and weird.

To this, I only have one piece of advice: tell them they can go to hell.  The world
needs more weird people -- people who know how things work, and who love to figure
stuff out.  So, whenever they try to mistreat you, just remember that this is *your*
journey, not theirs.  Being different is not a crime.  People who tell you it is are
just jealous that you've picked up a skill they could never acquire -- not in their
wildest dreams.

You can code; they cannot.  That is pretty damn cool.
