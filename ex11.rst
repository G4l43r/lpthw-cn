Exercise 11: Asking Questions
*****************************

Most of what software does is the following:

1. Take some kind of input from a person.
2. Change it.
3. Print out something to show how it changed.

So far you've only been printing things and the basics of changing it, but
you haven't been able to get any input in.  You may not even know what "input"
means, so rather than talk about it, let's have you do some and see if you get
it.  Next exercise we'll do more to explain it.


.. literalinclude:: ex/ex11.py

.. note::

    Notice that we put a ``,`` (comma) at the end of each ``print`` line.
    This is so that ``print`` doesn't end the line with a newline and go 
    to the next line.

What You Should See
===================


.. literalinclude:: ex/ex11.txt



Extra Credit
============

1. Go online and find out what Python's ``raw_input`` does.
2. Can you find other ways to use it?  Try some of the samples you find.
3. Write another "form" like this to ask some other questions.
