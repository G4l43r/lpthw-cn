Exercise 12: Prompting People
*****************************

When you typed ``raw_input()`` you were typing the ``(`` and ``)`` characters
which are ``parenthesis``.  This is similar to when you used them to do a
format with extra variables, as in ``"%s %s" % (x, y)``.  For ``raw_input`` you
can also put in a prompt to show to a person so they know what to type.  Put a
string that you want for the prompt inside the ``()`` so that it looks like
this:

.. code-block:: python

    y = raw_input("Name? ")

This prompts the user with "Name?" and puts the result into the variable ``y``.
This is how you ask someone a question and get their answer.

This means we can completely rewrite our previous exercise using just
``raw_input`` to do all the prompting.

Extra Credit
============

1. In Terminal where you normally run ``python`` to run your scripts, 
   type: ``pydoc raw_input``.  Read what it says.  If you're on Windows try
   ``python -m pydoc raw_input`` instead.
2. Get out of pydoc by typing ``q`` to quit.
3. Go look online for what the ``pydoc`` command does.
4. Use pydoc to also read about ``open``, ``file``, ``os``, and ``sys``.  It's alright if you
   do not understand those, just read through and take notes about interesting
   things.
