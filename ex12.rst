Exercise 12: Prompting People
*****************************

When you typed ``raw_input()`` you were typing the ``(`` and ``)`` characters
which are parenthesis.  This is similar to when you used them to do a format
with extra variables, as in ``"%s %s" % (x, y)``.  For ``raw_input`` you can
also put in a prompt to show to a person.  You put a string that you want
for the prompt inside the ``()`` so that it looks like this:

.. code-block:: python
    y = raw_input("Name? ")

Which prompts the user with "Name?" and puts the result into the variable ``y``.

This means we can completely rewrite our previous exercise using just
``raw_input`` to do all the prompting.

Extra Credit
============

1. In Terminal where you normally run ``python`` to run your scripts, 
   type: ``pydoc raw_input``.  Read what it says.
2. Go look online for what the ``pydoc`` command does.
3. Do pydoc for ``open``, ``file``, ``os``, and ``sys``.  It's alright if you
   don't understand those, just read through and take notes about interesting
   things.
