Exercise 20: Functions And Files
********************************

Remember your checklist for functions, then do this exercise 
paying close attention to how functions and files can work together
to make useful stuff.

.. literalinclude:: ex/ex20.py
    :linenos:

Pay close attention to how we pass in the current line number each time
we run ``print_a_line``.

What You Should See
===================

.. literalinclude:: ex/ex20.txt
    


Extra Credit
============

1. Go through and write English comments for each line to understand what's
   going on.
2. Each time ``print_a_line`` is run you are passing in a variable ``current_line``.
   Write out what ``current_line`` is equal to on each function call, and trace how it becomes
   ``line_count`` in ``print_a_line``.
4. Find each place a function is used, and go check its ``def`` to make sure that you are giving it the right arguments.
5. Research online what the ``seek`` function for ``file`` does.  Try ``pydoc file`` 
   and see if you can figure it out from there.
6. Research the shorthand notation ``+=`` and rewrite the script to use that.
